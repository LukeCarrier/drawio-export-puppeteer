## Hacking

We use [`asdf-vm`](https://asdf-vm.com/) with the [`nodejs`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) and [`yarn`](https://github.com/twuni/asdf-yarn) plugins to manage our tool versions. Complete the setup for `asdf-vm` first, or make sure you have compatible equivalents installed.

After cloning, make sure you get the vendored dependencies:

```console
git submodule update --init
```
